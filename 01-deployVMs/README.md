** Terraform with Cloud-init

Here's my workspace for learning terraform across Azure, AWS, and GCP. I'm also learning cloud-init so I can kickstart basic last mile configuration of new VMs, and get them ready for Ansible. I'll be practicing with various Linux flavors, including Ubuntu, Red Hat/CentOS, and Suse, to see how they work differently across each cloud provider.
